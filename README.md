# Gaze Control (üßë‚ÄçüíªSwift Student Challenge 2022 Winner)
A Swift Playgrounds app intended to experiment with the implementation of gaze control using ARKit's anchoring APIs.

The app provides a guided walkthrough on the importance of gaze control in accessibility, an overview of existing gaze control capabilities on Apple platforms, and demonstrations of different variants of gaze control (gesture to click, dwell click, etc.).

This project is inspired by the research of Martez E. Mott, Shane Williams, Jacob O. Wobbrock, and Meredith Ringel Morris, titled "Improving Dwell-Based Gaze Typing with Dynamic, Cascading Dwell Times" and published under the University of Washington's Information School and Microsoft Research.
